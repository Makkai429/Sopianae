        <h1>Sopianae - The Roman town beneath Pécs</h1>
        <p><strong>Sopianae</strong> is one of the most fascinating archaeological and cultural treasures of Central Europe.</p>
        <p>Hidden <em>beneath</em> the streets of modern <strong>Pécs</strong> lies a Roman town that once served as a vibrant administrative, commercial, and religious center on the northern frontier of the <strong>Roman Empire</strong>. Although nearly <em>two millennia</em> have passed since its founding, Sopianae continues to shape the identity of the city above it. Its remains <em>— painted burial chambers, monumental mausoleums, and fragments of Roman architecture —</em> offer a rare glimpse into the <b>everyday life, beliefs, and artistic traditions</b> of a late Roman provincial community.</p>
        <p>We invite you to <em>explore</em> Sopianae in depth. You will learn how the town <b>emerged</b> and <b>developed, what it looked like</b> at its peak, why it became a <b>center of early Christianity</b>, and how its <b>legacy</b> lives on in the cultural life of Pécs today. Whether you are a visitor, a student, or simply curious about the ancient world, Sopianae offers a <em>journey</em> into a past that is still remarkably present.</p>
