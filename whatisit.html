        <h1>What is Sopianae?</h1>
        <p>Sopianae was founded in the early 2nd century CE, during the reign of Emperor Hadrian, as part of the Roman province of Pannonia. Its location—at the foot of the Mecsek hills and near important trade routes—made it an ideal place for a regional center. Over time, Sopianae grew into a flourishing settlement with a diverse population of Roman citizens, local inhabitants, merchants, craftsmen, and soldiers.</p>

        <h2>Urban Structure and Architecture</h2>
        <p>Although much of the ancient town lies buried beneath modern Pécs, archaeological excavations have revealed a great deal about its layout and architecture. Sopianae featured:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stone-built residential houses with courtyards, storage rooms, and workshops</li>
            <li>Paved streets arranged in a loose grid pattern</li>
            <li>Public buildings such as administrative offices and meeting spaces</li>
            <li>Baths and water systems, including wells and drainage channels</li>
            <li>A large cemetery district on the northern slope, where early Christians built elaborate burial structures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unlike some Roman towns, Sopianae did not have a large amphitheatre or monumental forum. Instead, its character was shaped by its role as a regional administrative center and, later, as a hub of early Christian life.</p>

            <h2>A Center of Early Christianity</h2>
            <p>By the 4th century, Sopianae had become home to a significant Christian community. This is evident from the richly decorated burial chambers and chapels built in the cemetery district. These structures combine Roman architectural techniques with Christian symbolism, making Sopianae one of the most important early Christian archaeological sites in Europe.</p>
